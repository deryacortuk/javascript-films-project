Javascript-ES6
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
Use the keyword class to create a class, and always add a constructor method.

The constructor method is called each time the class object is initialized.

Methods
The constructor method is special, it is where you initialize properties, it is called automatically when a class is initiated,
and it has to have the exact name "constructor", in fact, if you do not have a constructor method, JavaScript will add an invisible 
and empty constructor method.

Static Methods
Static methods are defined on the class itself, and not on the prototype.
